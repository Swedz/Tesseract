## NeoForge Module Overview

### Hooking into Modern Industrialization
Although I am not a dev for [Modern Industrialization](https://github.com/AztechMC/Modern-Industrialization), Tesseract provides the ability for mods to hook into it rather easily while also avoiding conflicts with other mods.

Refer to [MI_HOOKS.md](neoforge/MI_HOOKS.md) for further information.
