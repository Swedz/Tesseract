# Tesseract
Tesseract is a series of multiple libraries used for my different projects. It is primarily Minecraft focused, but can be used for non-Minecraft projects too.

## Getting Started
Until I get around to setting up an actual repository for my projects, if you want to use them in your projects, you need to publish it to your local maven repository.
